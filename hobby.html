  <h1> I love to play chess </h1>
  <p> I went to Niles North High School where I learned how to play chess in my junior year. My chess rating started
      around 800, now I am 1497! My chess team got 5th place in Illinois State Champtionship in 2014. I also went to nationals two times.
      I won 2 trophies: I was placed 15th place in junior year and 7th place in senior year.
      I got to travel to San Diego and Nashville Tennessee. It was one of the unforgettable momemnts of my life. </p>
