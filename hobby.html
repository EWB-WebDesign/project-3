<h1> I love to play chess </h1>
<p> I learned how to play chess in my junior year of high school. My chess rating started around 800, now I am 1497!
    My chess team got 5th place in Illinois State Champtionship in 2014. I also went to nationals two times.
    I won 2 trophies: I was placed 15th place in junior year and 7th place in senior year.
    I got to travel to San Diego and Nashville Tennessee. It was one of the unforgettable momemnts of my life. </p>
